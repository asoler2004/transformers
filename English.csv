&quot; The potential productivity gains should be considerable .
"Today , QuarkXPress ® 8 has tighter integration with Photoshop ® and Illustrator ® than ever before , and through standards like HTML and CSS , QuarkXPress users can publish across media both independently and alongside Adobe ® Creative Suite ® applications like Adobe Flash ® ( SWF ) and Adobe Dreamweaver ® ."
"Here , you ’ ll find out how Creative Suite users can get the best possible interaction with QuarkXPress ."
You ’ ll be surprised how easy Quark has made it to unlock the full potential of all your design software .
QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop ’ s PSD file format of any layout tool available today .
In this section we ’ ll explain when you should use the PSD format for your images and how to get the most out of them .
"For example , you may have multiple layers in your PSD with different product shots , which will vary from publication to publication ."
"If you use PSD , you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate TIFF for each publication ."
"Another question that might tip you in favor of PSD is , &quot; Do I need to use a spot color with this image ?"
&quot; Using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated .
"However , because of the way QuarkXPress supports PSD channels , it ’ s simpler and more flexible ."
"Bringing the PSD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image . Create a Box and then use File &gt; Import ... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop , Finder or an application like Adobe Bridge ® with or without creating a box first ."
"To access the special features of PSD , open the PSD Import palette . ( Window &gt; PSD Import ) You ’ ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names ."
"For example , you ’ ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . One option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level ."
"If you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . For example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image ."
QuarkXPress can re ­ map any channel right in the PSD Import palette — non ­ destructively .
"So click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project ’ s color palette , ensuring consistency ."
"As powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can ’ t manipulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g."
"If you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won ’ t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette ."
"If you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand-alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; ."
"QuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls ."
Illustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations .
"Traditionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator ."
"Now , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 ."
Simply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format .
"QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn ’ t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet ."
"So if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non-white background or object , you might see undesirable results ."
"The good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead ."
"QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator , Freehand and similar tools ."

Page-layout professionals can create rich Flash projects — without compromising design — using the built – in Flash authoring capabilities included in every edition of QuarkXPress 8 .
"Working in the same familiar print environment of QuarkXPress 8 , you can take existing print jobs to Flash , or create new Flash projects , in minutes — no additional purchase or coding required !"

"Like in Europe , meat is prepared rare , mid rare , done , well done etc ."
"The sauce which comes with the meat dish is called &quot; chimichurri &quot; . However , because of the excellent taste of the meat , it can well be eaten without sauce ."

The Sausage ( chorizo ) and the black pudding ( morcilla ) are very popular .
"Served with the meats are vegetables ( sweet potatoes , pumpkin puree ) and mixed salads ."
In a restaurant it is of course possible to order other parts of meats .
"Depending on the season and region , it is possible to eat in Argentina very good food and meat such as deer , lamb , sheep , goat , fish , and other seafood ."
Special delicacies are : king prawns ( centolla ) from Tierra de Fuego and wild boar ( jabalí ) or trout in Bariloche .
"Special dishes , going back as far as colonial times are : &quot; pastel de choclo &quot; or the &quot; humita &quot; ."
"More typical are chicken &quot; pollo &quot; in its most varied prepartions , &quot; milanesa &quot; ( Viennese escalope ) , &quot; empanadas &quot; ( fried pastry shells filled with chopped beef , chicken , maize or cheese and ham ) or &quot; choripan &quot; similar to a Hot Dog ."

This section holds the most general questions about PHP : what it is and what it does .
Can I run several versions of PHP at the same time ?
What are the differences between PHP 3 and PHP 4 ?
What are the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5 ?
I think I found a bug ! Who should I tell ?
"Much of its syntax is borrowed from C , Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in ."
The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly .
This confuses many people because the first word of the acronym is the acronym .
This type of acronym is called a recursive acronym .
"For more information , the curious can visit » Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing or the » Wikipedia entry on recursive acronyms ."

Please see the » What &apos;s new in PHP 4 overview for a detailed explanation of these features and more .
"While PHP 5 was purposely designed to be as compatible as possible with previous versions , there are some significant changes ."
"For more detailed information , please view the section on Migrating from PHP 4 to PHP 5 and the section on Backwards Incompatible Changes ."
You should go to the PHP Bug Database and make sure the bug isn &apos;t a known bug .
"If you don &apos;t see it in the database , use the reporting form to report the bug ."

"is a string object that can have zero or more values , each of which must be chosen from a list of allowed values specified when the table is created ."
member values in the table definition when a table is created .
column are displayed using the lettercase that was used in the column definition .
columns can be assigned a character set and collation .
"For binary or case-sensitive collations , lettercase is taken into account when assigning values to the column ."
"values numerically , with the low-order bit of the stored value corresponding to the first set member ."
"value in a numeric context , the value retrieved has bits set corresponding to the set members that make up the column value ."
"column , the bits that are set in the binary representation of the number determine the set members in the column value ."
"element , it does not matter what order the elements are listed in when you insert the value ."
It also does not matter how many times a given element is listed in the value .
"When the value is retrieved later , each element in the value appears once , with elements listed according to the order in which they were specified at table creation time ."
"anywhere , even as a substring of another set member ."
The first of these statements looks for values containing the first set member .
The second looks for an exact match .
Be careful with comparisons of the second type .
You should specify the values in the same order they are listed in the column definition .
